I actually kinda hate hello world ya know
its like the only thing that people really
know how to say. It's always the first thing
you learn, and I've learned it so much.
echo hello_world
cringe
anyway
I dont know what else to write
so whoever sees this im sorry
hopefully in like 4 years my fingers will be flying across the keybaord at lightspeed hitting insane macros while creating the worlds first ai that can feel pain from the things you say and want to retaliate. Just because im crazy like that

Gonna make a quick edit here
git_test
I am using this to test the git commit through vscode
Trying this again
Because I was still using vim (yuck i know, I changed it to vscode)
